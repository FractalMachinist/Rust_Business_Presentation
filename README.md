# Rust Business Presentation
This repo documents my technical and professional communication skills, in the example context of advocating for using a specific language in an example business. When faced with important decisions, I follow these steps:

1. (Document)[/Zach%20Allen%20C768%20Task%201.pdf] my research about the company, its needs, and whether a particular solution can fill those needs.
2. (Summarize)[/Zach%20Allen%20C768%20Task%202.pdf] my findings to relevant audiences, tailored to their goals and expertise.
3. (Communicate)[Zach%20Allen%20C768%20Task%203.pdf] my findings in a presentation, when asked.
